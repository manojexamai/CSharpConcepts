SOLID Principles 
5 principles for clean, flexible, and maintainable code

S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
	A class should have only one reason to change.
	Doing too many things in one class makes it harder to maintain.

O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
	Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
	Add new features without touching existing code.

L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
	Subclasses must be substitutable for their base class.
	If a subclass breaks parent behaviour, the system becomes unstable.

I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
	Prefer many small, specific interfaces over one large, general-purpose interface.
	Implement only what your class actually needs.

D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
	Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
	This makes code more flexible, testable, and easier to maintain.
